So let's get started on how to build our weather application! 

# Application Layout (XML Layout)

The first step in creating our application, we need to develop our layout. So what is a layout? Layout is basically how our application will looks like. 

I will briefly explains the features included in our application:

```
        <TextView
            android:id="@+id"
            android:layout_width=""
            android:layout_height=""
            android:textSize="" />
```

TextView is used to show the texts that we have created.

```
        <Button
            android:id="@+id/"
            android:layout_width=""
            android:layout_height=""
             />

```

Button feature is for clicking

```
<Linear Layout>

   </Linear Layout>
```

For this application we will use LinearLayout

```
        <Space
            android:layout_width=""
            android:layout_height="" />
```

Space is for creating spaces between the elements


Now onto the Java Programming
